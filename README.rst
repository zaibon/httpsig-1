Sign HTTP requests with secure signatures according to the IETF HTTP Signatures specification (`Draft 3`_).  This is a fork of the original module_ to fully support both RSA and HMAC schemes as well as unit test both schemes to prove they work.  It's being used in production and is actively-developed.

See the original project_, original Python module_, original spec_, and `current IETF draft`_ for more details on the signing scheme.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
* PyCrypto_

Optional:

* requests_

.. _requests: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests

Usage
-----

Real documentation is forthcoming, but for now this should get you started.

For simple raw signing:

.. code:: python

    import httpsig
    
    secret = open('rsa_private.pem', 'rb').read()
    
    sig_maker = httpsig.Signer(secret=secret, algorithm='rsa-sha256')
    sig_maker.sign('hello world!')

For general use with web frameworks:
    
.. code:: python

    import httpsig
    
    key_id = "Some Key ID"
    secret = b'some big secret'
    
    hs = httpsig.HeaderSigner(key_id, secret, algorithm="hmac-sha256", headers=['(request-target)', 'host', 'date'])
    signed_headers_dict = hs.sign({"Date": "Tue, 01 Jan 2014 01:01:01 GMT", "Host": "example.com"}, method="GET", path="/api/1/object/1")

For use with requests:

.. code:: python

    import json
    import requests
    from httpsig.requests_auth import HTTPSignatureAuth
    
    secret = open('rsa_private.pem', 'rb').read()
    
    auth = HTTPSignatureAuth(key_id='Test', secret=secret)
    z = requests.get('https://api.example.com/path/to/endpoint', 
                             auth=auth, headers={'X-Api-Version': '~6.5'})

Class initialization parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that keys and secrets should be bytes objects.  At attempt will be made to convert them, but if that fails then exceptions will be thrown.

.. code:: python

    httpsig.Signer(secret, algorithm='rsa-sha256')

``secret``, in the case of an RSA signature, is a string containing private RSA pem. In the case of HMAC, it is a secret password.  
``algorithm`` is one of the six allowed signatures: ``rsa-sha1``, ``rsa-sha256``, ``rsa-sha512``, ``hmac-sha1``, ``hmac-sha256``, 
``hmac-sha512``.


.. code:: python

    httpsig.requests_auth.HTTPSignatureAuth(key_id, secret, algorithm='rsa-sha256', headers=None)

``key_id`` is the label by which the server system knows your RSA signature or password.  
``headers`` is the list of HTTP headers that are concatenated and used as signing objects. By default it is the specification's minimum, the ``Date`` HTTP header.  
``secret`` and ``algorithm`` are as above.
